# Voice-Recording-And-Transcription
Put together by Balazs Dukat in November 2025
An Electron app to record and transcribe voice

The transcription needs ggml-base.en.bin (the transcriber model) to be in \Transcriber\resources\models
You will need to download it from:
https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/main

And the whisper-cli executable in \Transcriber\resources from:
https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp/releases
(it is the whisper-bin-x64.zip that will contain the one I used.)
